# DiamondsPricePredicton
Machine Learning Explore and visualize Diamonds dataset. 
I shall use three libraries for visualization - matplotlib,pandas,numpy,skLearn and seaborn.   
The objective of this Dataset is to try with different visuals and make sense of the data.    
I shall also split the data into training and test dataset with different proportions.     
Check the change in accuracy to apply ML algorithm.
